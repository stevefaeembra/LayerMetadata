Layer MetaData is a plugin which allows you to browse metadata for all layers in the current project.

You can group layers by a number of different factors, such as CRS, class (raster/vector), provider (GDAL/OGR/postgres) or extent, for example.

You can then drill-down to individual metadata items, and copy their values to the clipboard.

It's implemented as a Dock, use "View > Panels > Layer Metadata" to show the dock.
