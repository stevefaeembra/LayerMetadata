<h3>Layer Metadata</h3>
<p>The standard layers plugin shows symbology. This plugin adds an alternative layer dock which is optimised for basic metadata access</p><p>You can group layers by a number of criteria such as type, provider or CRS</p><p>You can then drill down into basic layer metadata fields such as proj4, extent, field info and copy these to the clipboard with <b>Ctrl-C</b></p><p>Open the dock using <b>View > Panels > Layer Metadata</b></p><p>A dialog based version is also available using the toolbar icon... it's not as fully-featured, but gives much more space on smaller screens.</p>
